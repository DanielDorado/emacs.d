Intro
=====

This is my configuration for emacs.


Installation
============

On Linux: Clone this repository to: `~/.emacs.d`

```
# install epc and jedi
pip install epc jedi
git clone https://github.com/purcell/emacs.d.git ~/.emacs.d
```

Software necessary
------------------

This is tested with Emacs 24. But I was working with Emacs 23 and all
worked well.
